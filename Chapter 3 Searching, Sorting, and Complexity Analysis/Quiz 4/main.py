My answer to Chapter 2 Quiz 4.

A little bit complex, maybe this is not the best answer.
The loop count equals to it's binary length + bit 1's count.
For an example: exponent 100,
bin(100) == '0b1100100'
So the count is len('1100100') + 3(This is 3 bits which is 1), which is 10 times.
BTW, a bit-1 means one more step 'number * expoHelper(number, exponent-1)'.

complexity: O(logn+k) â‰ˆ O(logn)
